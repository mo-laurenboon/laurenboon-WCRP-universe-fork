Grid properties are specific to the native grid of each model component, which is the grid on which the component is integrated and is split into separate horizontal and vertical parts. 

The horizontal and vertical parts of the grid are described with a standardised specification that is based on selections from controlled vocabularies or the provision of numerical values. 

There are many properties in the grid descriptions, but only a subset will apply to any given grid. For instance, a regular latitude-longitude grid does not need to provide any of the spectral grid truncation properties.

**Note:** _A model component may output variables on non-native grids (such as data on constant pressure levels from a model component with a terrain-following native vertical grid), or its output variables may be post-processed to non-native grids for storage in archived datasets (such as data interpolated to a regular 1 degree grid from a model component with a variable resolution native horizontal grid). However, it is always the native grid on which the model component is integrated that is requested here._
