Please describe the dynamic model component, which are those that dynamically simulate their processes.

All dynamically simulated components within a model interact with each other either directly or
indirectly. The EMD only describes direct interactions between components, characterising them
as either “embedded” or “coupled”, and recording this using the Embedded in and Coupled with
model component properties respectively.

**Note:** _Beyond the characterisation of “embedded” or “coupled”, the EMD does not include further
information about the nature of component interactions (e.g. it does not state which physical
quantities are exchanged between components, nor how frequently these exchanges occur)._

The following characteristics can be used to help determine whether a component is “embedded
in” or “coupled with” another component:

What constitutes an "embedded" component? 
<details>
<summary>Click the arrow to learn more.</summary>

  An “embedded” component typically:
  - shares the same horizontal grid as the host component;
  - is constructed such that the code representing the component would be exceedingly
difficult to extract and transfer to another coupled model;
  - is coded such that within a single time-step, interactions between it and its host might
involve exchanges of information affecting both;
  - cannot be easily “driven” independently of its host (e.g. it cannot be run by itself in standalone
“offline” mode with prescribed external conditions imposed);
  - may not have a recognisable name or version number (other than those of the host
component).

What constitutes an "coupled" component? 
<details>
<summary>Click the arrow to learn more.</summary>

  A “coupled” component typically:
  - is identified using a recognisable name, and often a version number (e.g. “MOM5”, the
fifth version of the Modular Ocean Model);
  - interacts at regular intervals with other components by exchanging the collection of
quantities needed by each to advance a simulation (such as mass, momentum, energy,
etc.), either via a coupler (i.e. code specially adapted to represent the exchanges between
the various components) or by other means;
  - is coded such that it is relatively isolated from other parts of a coupled model code and
(by design) might be extracted to be adopted in another model.

**Note:** _A component must be either embedded in another component or else coupled with other
components, but can not be both._

**Note:** _The distinction between these two types may not always be obvious, and in some cases
a somewhat arbitrary choice may have to be made. For instance, this could be the case when a
component satisfies characteristics from both interaction types (e.g. it is possible for a component
with a recognisable name and version number to be embedded in a host, rather than coupled)._

An embedded component has a single host component, and can not be coupled with any other
components. Multiple components can be embedded in the same host. When there is more than
one candidate for the host component, it should be chosen as the one that most directly influences
the other components' processes. For instance, the ocean biogeochemistry, sea ice, and ocean
components of a coupled model might be treated together in the model code, but both sea ice
and ocean biogeochemistry are considered to be embedded in the host ocean because, although
there may be direct interactions and exchanges between the ocean biogeochemistry and sea ice,
both of these components are more strongly influenced by properties primarily determined by the
ocean component (e.g. the sea water temperature and salinity).

A non-embedded component must be coupled with one or more other components. Coupling
(unlike embedding) is symmetrical, in that if component X is coupled with component Y, then
component Y must also be coupled with component X, and this would be recorded in the Coupled
with properties of both components. For instance, an ocean component might commonly be
coupled with the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean biogeochemistry, but it could also be coupled
with the land surface component (if river water discharge into the ocean were explicitly calculated
by the land model and “seen” by the ocean) and the land ice component (if the melting of an ice
shelf contributed mass to the ocean or if heat or momentum fluxes were exchanged at the base
of the ice shelf).
